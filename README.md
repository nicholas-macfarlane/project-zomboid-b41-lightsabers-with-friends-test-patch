*should* be all you need to add auto lightsaber on/off on equip/unequip for Lightsaber with Friends

File location will be something like <drive>:\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\108600\3001004191\mods\Lightsabers With Friends\media\lua\client\

Just replace the file in the mod folder and... fingers crossed... voila!

On Windows / Proton prefixes the local mod folder is something like <drive>:\Users\<username>\Zomboid\mods\

You *may* have to just move the whole thing ( Lightsabers with Friends" folder ) over to the local mods folder to keep Steam from overwriting it with the Workshop version.

mod structure-wise, the file sits at Lightsabers With Friends\media\lua\client\LightsabersWithFriends_Lightsaber.lua

Memory says this was working locally and a quick glance at it looks like it should do the thing, but I haven't tested it in a LONG time.
